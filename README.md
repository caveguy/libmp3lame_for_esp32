=================================================================================
Using the LAME encoding engine (or other mp3 encoding technology) in your software 
may require a patent license in some countries.

As LAME may contain software for which some companies may claim software
patents, if you are in a location where software patents are recognized, it is
suggested that you seek legal advice before deploying and/or redistributing
LAME.

In particular, it is suggested to visit
